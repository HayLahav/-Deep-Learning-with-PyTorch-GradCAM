GradCAM (Gradient Class Activation Map) is a technique used in computer vision and deep learning to visualize and understand the regions of an input image that contribute the most to a particular class prediction made by a neural network. It works by computing the gradients of the target class's output with respect to the intermediate feature maps of the network, and then combining these gradients to highlight the important regions in the original image. GradCAM helps provide insights into which parts of the image the model focuses on to make its predictions, aiding in interpretability and analysis of deep learning models.
